### Hassles of Physical Menus for Diners.

Welcome to the quirky world of physical menus! While they may seem like innocent sheets of paper, these humble menus harbor a secret: they have their fair share of drawbacks and limitations. In this blog, we embark on an amusing yet eye-opening journey to explore the woes of physical menus, regardless of the ongoing pandemic. So, fasten your seatbelts and get ready for a humorous yet revealing ride!

#### 1. The Shapeshifting Shenanigans

Physical menus have an uncanny ability to transform overnight, leaving customers bewildered. You might have carefully perused the menu online, only to discover a completely different version when you sit down at the restaurant. It's like dining in a culinary Twilight Zone where the dishes you were excited about suddenly vanish, replaced by mysterious newcomers.

#### 2. The Sticky Fingers Mystery

Ever had the joy of encountering a sticky, greasy menu? It's like playing a game of "Guess the Dish" as you try to decipher the hidden options beneath the gunk. Is it a chicken entrée or a modern art masterpiece? The choice is yours to make! But hey, a little smudge never hurt anyone, right?

#### 3. Lost in Translation

Physical menus can be a real puzzler when it comes to deciphering foreign languages. You may find yourself on a linguistic adventure, attempting to decode a menu written in a dialect that seems like a fusion of ancient hieroglyphs and cryptic symbols. Who knew ordering a simple appetizer could require a PhD in linguistics?

#### 4. The Dreaded Turnaround Time

One of the biggest drawbacks of physical menus is the impact on the speed of service. Waiting for physical menus to be handed out, returned, and passed between diners can significantly slow down the overall dining experience. It's as if time takes a leisurely stroll while you anxiously await the chance to place your order and savor the deliciousness.

#### 5. The Awkward Wait Time

Picture this: You're at a bustling restaurant, hungry and ready to order. But there's just one problem—you're stuck waiting for the overwhelmed server to bring you a physical menu. Minutes turn into hours as you twiddle your thumbs, longing for the moment when you can finally make your dining desires known. Time flies when you're having fun... right?

From shape-shifting menus to sticky situations, language puzzles to the dreaded turnaround time, these drawbacks can slow down the dining experience and impact the overall efficiency of the restaurant. So, the next time you encounter a physical menu, remember the hidden tales they hold and embrace the humorous side of the dining journey.
